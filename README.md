# Code Encoding Formats Test Repository

This repository contains code files with different encoding formats to test encoding handling.

## Test Scenarios
- Different character encodings (UTF-8, UTF-16, ASCII)
- Different line endings (CRLF, LF, CR)
- Different indentation styles (spaces vs tabs)
- Different comment styles and formatting
